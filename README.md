## Project Overview

### Description

FlyAway is an airline booking portal developed as a Full Stack Developer project. The goal is to design and implement a user-friendly platform for booking flights.

### Background

FlyAway serves as a ticket-booking portal where users can book flights through a website. The project involves creating a web application with the following features:

- A search form on the homepage for entering travel details (date, source, destination, number of persons).
- Display of available flights with ticket prices based on entered travel details.
- User registration and personal details entry for booking confirmation.
- Integration of a dummy payment gateway for payment processing.
- Admin backend with features such as login, password change, master lists of places, airlines, and flight details.

### Flow and Features

- Plan more than two sprints for application development.
- Document the application flow and create a flow chart.
- Implement core concepts and algorithms, including exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization.
- Use Scrum as an efficient agile framework for incremental product delivery.
- Apply search and sort techniques with relevant data structures.
- Utilize Eclipse/IntelliJ as the IDE, Java for coding, SQL for database creation, Maven for project setup, Git for version control, and GitHub for repository hosting.
- Specify project details, developer information, sprints, tasks achieved, algorithms, and GitHub repository links in the final specification document.

## Requirements

- Push source code to GitHub repository and document the steps and algorithms.
- Share the GitHub repository link for task tracking.
- Document the step-by-step process from sprint planning to product release.
- Ensure the application handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- Submit a final specification document containing project and developer details, sprints and achieved tasks, algorithms, and GitHub repository links.
